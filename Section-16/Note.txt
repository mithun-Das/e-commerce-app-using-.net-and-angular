-> It is recommended approach to implement validation in database level like ProductConfiguration.cs
   But we can also implement it in high level. We can implement in the entity level.
   We can apply data annotation in property

-> Since we configured Nullable enable, so we do not require to put data annotation [Required] in AddressDto Model.
   But problem is empty string and null are not same thing. So we do not receive any error when we send empty string 
   for a string field. To prevent this we need required data annotation in string field. 
   Here we want to implement validation where user passes data rather than entity.
