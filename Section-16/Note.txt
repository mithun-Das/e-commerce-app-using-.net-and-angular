---------------> Section-16: Part-182 -> Model validation <---------------


-> It is recommended approach to implement validation in database level like ProductConfiguration.cs
   But we can also implement it in high level. We can implement in the entity level.
   We can apply data annotation in property

-> Since we configured Nullable enable, so we do not require to put data annotation [Required] in AddressDto Model.
   Here we want to implement validation where user passes data rather than entity.
