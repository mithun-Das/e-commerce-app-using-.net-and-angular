-> List of HTTP status codes
   src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

   1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
   2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
   3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
   4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
   5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request

-------------> Section-5: Part-53 -> Creating Exception handler middleware <-------------

-> We needed to put [HttpGet] in ErrorController before the "Error" method.
   Since it was giving error in swagger.

-> public class ApiException : ApiResponse
   When we inherit a class , we also needed to match appropriate constructor

   For example, in this case when we just inherit ApiResponse class it was showing error
   saying that there is no parameterless constructor in ApiResponse class

-> RequestDelegate
-> IHostEnvironment
-> HttpContext
-> "InvokeAsync" in middleware
-> await _next(context) => It means the request will go to the next stage if no exception occurs
-> Middleware
   src: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/aspnet-core-middleware

-> JsonSerializer.Serialize((ApiException)response);
   We needed to explicitly casting here because without it "Details" property was not getting serialized	


-------------> Section-5: Part-54 -> Improving the validation error responses <-------------

-> Without [ApiController] attribute, no details message will appear
   if it encounters what it sees as a validation error, then it adds the error to something called
   to model state and then this model state error response to our API server is generating and sending
   back to us.


-> Earlier on, I mentioned that anything inside Configure Service, the ordering is not particularly important.
   However, there's always an exception, and Configure endpoint is the one because 
   we want to configure something related to our controllers.

   If we try and do this above AddController, then this doesn't seem to work.
   And we do have to actually add this particular service or configuration after the controllers in this case.
