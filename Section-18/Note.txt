-> Owned Entity
   We do not need to keep Id property in owned entity

-> Previously created Address entity is tightly bound to our identity.
   And remember, this one is in a separate context boundary 
   and is physically separated from our application in a different database.
   So Address entity created for Order will be owned by order.

-> Entity Framework needs a parameterless constructor.

-> ProductItemOrdered is just going to act as a snapshot of our order at the time or our product item at the time,
   it was placed just based on the fact that the product name might change, the product image might change,
   but we wouldn't want to change it as well inside our order.
   So we don't want to relation between our order and our product item.
   We're going to store the values as it was when it was ordered into our database.
