------------------> Section-3: Part-23 -> Adding a Repository and Interface <------------------

-> GetProductByIdAsync => Async only entier, it's just a naming convention, and it's just so that we can easily identify that
			  this is going to return a task and we can await this particular method when we call it in the controller.

-> IReadOnlyList => we've been returning just the list when we return something or a list of something.
		    But we can be more specific. And the list is a very generic list, objects that supports lots of different things with a list,
 		    we can add items to it, we can remove items from it.
		    And and IReadOnly type of list is very much more specific.
		    We can only ever read, as the name implies, from what we're sending back here.
		    And because we're returning a list, we don't need the functionality that comes with a normal list that
		    allows us to add and remove items from it.
		    So when we're returning something like this, we can be more specific about what we're returning and
		    we're going to use an IReadOnly list in this case.


------------------> Section-3: Part-26 -> Creating a new migration for the entities <------------------

    public ProductType ProductType { get; set; }
    public int ProductTypeId { get; set; }
    public ProductBrand ProductBrand { get; set; }
    public int ProductBrandId { get; set;}

-> Here ProductTypeId and ProductBrandId was introduced as Foreign Key during Migration.
   So by using this Naming convention helps to do that as well as EF recognize that.
   If we would name it ProdBrdId, then it wouldn't work. Rather it would create another column name  ProductBrandId.
   But we can handle this via Migration Configuration


------------------> Section-3: Part-27 -> Configuring the migrations <------------------

-> We could apply this config in context class.  But it will be large if we do that(We did that in dating app)

-> For string => Instead of configuring the entity in the Migration Configuration(ProductConfiguration)
                 by IsRequired, I made it non-nullable in the entity class since .net6 provides that feature.

->         builder.HasOne(x => x.ProductBrand).WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.ProductBrandId);

   We can apply this in config but EF has already took care of this which we have seen in previous migration
   because this entity class is already been declared like that	
   We can spicify what our entity or migration look like

------------------> Section-3: Part-28 -> Applying the migrations and creating the Database at app startup <------------------


-> Instead of "Update Database" command, we are going to apply the latest migration via code.
   And this is still Microsoft's currently recommended way of doing such a thing.

------------------> Section-3: Part-30 -> Adding the code to get the product brands and types <------------------

-> {{url}}/api/products/brands
   For this postman call we get 400 status
   But if we remove [ApiController] attribute then we receive 204 status
   API controller is actually doing for us there, it's actually doing some validation to make sure that the
   Route parameter here is actually an integer.
