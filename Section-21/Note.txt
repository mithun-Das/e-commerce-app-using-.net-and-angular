-> If Stripe account can't be open from Bangladesh then how it can be used from Bangladesh?
   (ask Sabbir bhai)

-> The cost for this is per transaction, 2.9% plus a 30% charge.
   Now, if that sounds excessive to you, then they're handling or taking all the risk.
   They've got all the infrastructure and they're still taking Card payments.

   Now, if you were to take Stripe out of the equation and you were just taking a Visa or MasterCard payment
   directly, you're still going to be paying Visa or MasterCard something like 2% anyway per transaction.
   And the only free way of taking money is to simply take cash.

   what we're going to take a look at is very standard shopping cart where we expect people to pay
   for their goods via credit card or bank debit card, and Stripe is going to allow us to do that.
