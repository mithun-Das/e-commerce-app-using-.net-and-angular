--------------> Section-21: Part-254 -> Setting up stripe <---------------

-> If Stripe account can't be open from Bangladesh then how it can be used from Bangladesh?
   (ask Sabbir bhai)

-> The cost for this is per transaction, 2.9% plus a 30% charge.
   Now, if that sounds excessive to you, then they're handling or taking all the risk.
   They've got all the infrastructure and they're still taking Card payments.

   Now, if you were to take Stripe out of the equation and you were just taking a Visa or MasterCard payment
   directly, you're still going to be paying Visa or MasterCard something like 2% anyway per transaction.
   And the only free way of taking money is to simply take cash.

   what we're going to take a look at is very standard shopping cart where we expect people to pay
   for their goods via credit card or bank debit card, and Stripe is going to allow us to do that.
   (Don't got this point) 



--------------> Section-21: Part-261 -> Implementing stripe elements <---------------


->    <div class="form-control" #cardNumber>
           <label>Card Number</label>
      </div>

 	=> Now, the idea of this is that we're going to use Stripe elements and it's going to replace what's inside
	   this div with a stripe element that's going to allow the user to securely input their card number.
	   And we ourselves are not going to be able to access that card number.
	   And nor is any other malicious JavaScript because of the security functionality that Stripe have implemented
	   inside that JavaScript.


--------------> Section-21: Part-262 -> Adding stripe elements to the components <---------------

=> Now, there is a kind of simpler approach to using this.
   But would use stripes styling and we'd have an all in one kind of input.
   And the reason for the separate inputs is so that we can stick with our bootstrap fluting, label,
   styling and control each of these elements individually.
   So it's a little bit more work, but the end result is that we've got control over how things are going
   to look and how we validate each of these inputs as well.
